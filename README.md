# js-special-topics
In the course, we do not teach javascript, since we expect you know the basics of it from cs32. However, since cs32's transition to react in 2020, there may be a hole of knowledge on vanilla javascript that you may have missed.

For your non-react projects (or any lightweight website), you may want to use vanilla javascript to add additional interactions of animations to your website. 

Our goal is to offer you these tools to incorporate vanilla javascript in a simple effective way into your website. It will also offer a strong foundation which will serve you well for the react project.

## Topics
